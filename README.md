# Blockchain-Based Retail Staff Scheduling

A decentralized platform for transparent, efficient, and compliant retail workforce management.

## Overview

The Blockchain-Based Retail Staff Scheduling platform leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize how retail businesses manage employee scheduling, verification, and labor compliance. By distributing critical workforce operations across smart contracts, this solution creates an immutable record of store locations, employee qualifications, shift assignments, and regulatory complianceâ€”ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability throughout the scheduling process.
